Event Overview:

Divided into two main segments, a Jeopardy Style CTF and an Attack-Defense Style CTF, participants will face challenges, learn, and compete for exciting prizes.

Jeopardy Style CTF:

In this session, participants will face a grid of challenges resembling the popular Jeopardy game format. All questions will be visible simultaneously, offering a comprehensive view of the playing field. The dynamic points system adds an extra layer of excitement—each challenge starts with 500 points, and as more participants conquer a challenge, its points decrease for everyone.


Attack-Defense Style CTF:

Dive into the heart of cybersecurity warfare with our Attack-Defense style CTF. Teams will be divided into 10 factions, each comprising approximately 20 teams. Each faction will have access to a dedicated server loaded with various vulnerabilities, providing a real-world simulation for participants.

Faction Allocation for Attack-Defense Style CTF:

Teams will be divided into factions cyclically based on their Round 1 (Jeopardy Style CTF) score. For instance, if we have 6 teams and 3 factions:

Faction 1: 1,4

Faction 2: 2,5

Faction 3: 3,6

Winner Selection:

Final points = Jeopardy Style CTF (Round 1) + Attack-Defense Style CTF (Round 2)

1st, 2nd, and 3rd based on the final score.

Prizes and Goodies:

Goodies for all teams of the winning faction.
